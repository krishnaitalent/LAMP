	* [Click here](https://github.com/Azure/Moodle/blob/master/README.md) to choose Fully configurable deployment
	* Click Deploy to Azure button and it should go to Azure sbscription custom deployment page after successful login.
- Copy the moodle & moodle data files from Azure blob storage to shared folder (/moodle) in the Azure VM.
- Create Database for Moodle.

- Configure moodle, certs, PHP, nginx configuration based on the OnPrem.


## Option 2

- Install the infra using azure portal
- Create Vnets, Subnets, NIC, Load balancer, VMscaleset etc.
- Install LAMP stack using a shell script or manual install on Azure VMs.
- Copy the PHP, nginx configurations from blob to azure using a script.
- Copy Moodle folder from blob storage to respective file storage which will be used by the VMâ€™s
